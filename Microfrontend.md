# Angular Micro Frontend Interview Questions and Answers

## General Micro Frontend Questions

### 1. What are Micro Frontends?
Micro frontends are an architectural approach in which a single frontend application is broken down into smaller, independently deployable parts, each owned by different teams. Each micro frontend can be built using different technologies, and they come together to form a cohesive user experience.

### 2. What are the benefits of using micro frontends?
- **Scalability**: Teams can work on individual features without interfering with others.
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can use different technologies or frameworks.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller codebases are easier to maintain and test.
- **Independent Deployment**: Micro frontends can be updated and deployed independently.

### 3. What are the challenges of implementing micro frontends?
- **Cross-Application Communication**: Ensuring micro frontends communicate seamlessly.
- **Shared Dependencies**: Handling different versions of shared dependencies.
- **Consistent UX**: Maintaining a consistent user experience across all micro frontends.
- **Complexity**: Increased complexity in development, deployment, and testing.

### 4. What are some common approaches to implementing micro frontends?
- **Iframe-based**: Each micro frontend runs in an iframe.
- **Web Components**: Using custom elements to encapsulate micro frontend features.
- **Module Federation**: Using Webpack to share modules between applications.
- **Single SPA**: A framework for building multiple micro frontends that coexist in one frontend application.

### 5. What is Module Federation in Webpack, and how does it help in micro frontend architecture?
Module Federation allows JavaScript applications to share and consume modules dynamically at runtime. This enables sharing components or services between different micro frontends, reducing duplication and allowing true integration.

### 6. How do you handle routing in a micro frontend architecture?
Routing can be managed in two ways:
- **Centralized Routing**: A shell application manages all the routes and loads appropriate micro frontends.
- **Local Child Routes**: Each micro frontend manages its own internal routing.

### 7. How do you manage shared dependencies across multiple micro frontends?
- **Shared Libraries**: Host shared dependencies in a common library.
- **Webpack Module Federation**: Declare shared modules in Webpack configuration.
- **Singleton Versions**: Use a single instance of shared dependencies to avoid conflicts.

### 8. How do you ensure consistent styling across micro frontends?
- **Shared Design System**: Use a shared design system with common styles and components.
- **CSS Variables**: Define global CSS variables to ensure a consistent theme.
- **Global Stylesheets**: Apply a global stylesheet for basic styling.

### 9. How do you handle authentication in a micro frontend architecture?
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Use a central identity provider.
- **Shared Session Management**: Store authentication tokens in a shared cookie or local storage.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Pass tokens to micro frontends to manage access control.

### 10. How do you decide what should be a micro frontend?
Decide based on:
- **Team Boundaries**: Allocate micro frontends to independent teams.
- **Feature Scope**: Features that can be developed independently.
- **Independence**: Features that do not tightly depend on other features.
- **Deployment Requirements**: Features that need to be deployed separately.

## Angular-Specific Micro Frontend Questions

### 1. How can you implement a micro frontend with Angular?
Use **Webpack Module Federation** with Angular CLI. Configure Module Federation in the `webpack.config.js` file to expose components and consume other Angular modules across different applications.

### 2. What is Angular Module Federation, and how does it work?
Module Federation allows Angular applications to share or consume modules from other applications. You configure Angular's Webpack Module Federation Plugin to specify the shared modules.

### 3. How would you share Angular services between micro frontends?
- **Module Federation**: Share services across micro frontends using Module Federation.
- **Singleton Services**: Register services as singletons to ensure only one instance is used.
- **Shared Library**: Create a shared library to reuse services.

### 4. What is the role of Angular `@NgModule` in micro frontend architecture?
`@NgModule` is used to encapsulate related components, directives, and services, making them independently loadable and reusable across different micro frontends.

### 5. How can Angular Elements be used in micro frontends?
Angular Elements allows you to convert Angular components into **Web Components**, which can then be used across different frameworks, making them an ideal solution for micro frontends.

### 6. How do you handle inter-micro frontend communication in Angular?
- **Custom Events**: Use browser events for communication.
- **Shared Services**: Use shared services to store common data.
- **RxJS Subjects**: Use RxJS subjects to propagate events between micro frontends.
- **Global State Management**: Use tools like **NgRx** or **Redux** to manage shared state.

### 7. How do you handle Angular version conflicts across micro frontends?
- Use a **consistent Angular version** across all micro frontends.
- Ensure **backward compatibility** by using common interfaces and services.
- **Module Federation** allows different versions, but compatibility issues should be handled carefully.

### 8. What is the difference between a shell and a remote in Angular micro frontends?
- **Shell**: The host application that provides a framework for other micro frontends.
- **Remote**: The independent micro frontend that is loaded into the shell.

### 9. How would you optimize the load time of micro frontends in Angular?
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components on demand to reduce initial load time.
- **Tree-Shaking**: Remove unused code from the final bundle.
- **Differential Loading**: Serve different bundles to modern and legacy browsers.
- **Code Splitting**: Split the application into smaller chunks.

### 10. How do you handle error boundaries between micro frontends?
- Use Angular's **global error handler** (`ErrorHandler`) to catch errors.
- Implement **error boundaries** at the micro frontend level.
- Use **fallback UIs** to display meaningful messages when an error occurs.
